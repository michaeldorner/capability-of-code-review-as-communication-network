# Testing

I would like to understand how reliable are the results that the simulation produces.

Develop a test suite for a [scientific simulation](https://github.com/michaeldorner/information-diffusion-boundaries-in-code-review).

Your test suite

1. tests for correctness and stability of the simulation results.
2. supports continuous testing with GitHub Actions.
3. reports test coverage via [badges](https://shields.io/category/coverage).
4. tests both Python 3.10 and 3.11.
5. does not degrade the overall code quality.
6. tests with and without orjson installed.

In your final report (<8 pages), you

- discuss the completeness of your test suite through a traceability matrix.
- discuss your test suite including applied strategies.
- discuss the finings of your test suite.
- discuss the limitations and shortcomings of your test suite.
- discuss how we could test for runtime or memory performance.

Your final report does not exceed 8 pages, lists all team member and lists in detail their contributions to the report and code.
